# Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning



## Project Overview

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a valuable Natural Language Processing (NLP) application that aims to determine the emotional tone behind text. In this project, we employ various machine learning algorithms to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of textual reviews.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Python Environment and Libraries:** You'll need a Python environment with the following libraries installed:
   - `scikit-learn` (sklearn): For machine learning models.
   - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
   - `numpy`: For numerical operations.
   - `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For data visualization.
   - `nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit): For text preprocessing.
   - `spacy`: For more advanced text preprocessing.
   - `google.colab`: For Google Colab integration.

- **Dataset:**
   - Prepare a CSV dataset for training and testing your sentiment analysis model. Ensure it has two columns: 'review' (textual data) and 'sentiment' (positive or negative sentiment labels). Due to the large size of the dataset (55MB), consider compressing the zip file and include it in your repository.

   **Note:** Mention in the README that the dataset is compressed into a zip file in the repository.

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Data Loading:** Start by loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. You can do this as follows:

   ```python
   with open('/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset.csv') as file:
       articles = file
   df = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset.csv')

- **Data Preprocessing:** Before feeding the data into machine learning models, perform essential preprocessing tasks:

   - Removing Stopwords: Eliminate common English words that don't contribute significantly to the text's meaning using NLTK's stopwords list.

   - Tokenization and Vectorization: Tokenize the text (split it into individual words) and convert it into numerical features using CountVectorizer from scikit-learn.
